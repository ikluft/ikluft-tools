Revision history for the WebFetch modules for Perl5

0.11
      - converted the following modules to support Embedding API:
      	DebianNews, General
      - removed fetch_main function from the derived modules; WebFetch.pm now
        handles this for all of them.  (This is a partial fix for a problem
	with embedding more than one WebFetch module at a time, reported by
	Joey Hess of the Debian Project.)
      - fixed pod formatting problem in Embedding API docs

0.10 Wed Sep 15 01:23:53 PDT 1999
      - added WebFetch Embedding API (added over 850 lines to WebFetch.pm)
      - XML::Parser added as a build-time dependency
      - the Slashdot and LinuxToday modules now fetch their news via XML
      - converted the following modules to support Embedding API:
        CNETnews, CNNsearch, COLA, Freshmeat, SiteNews, Slashdot
	(upcoming releases will convert more until all are done)
      - modules with the Embedding API can now all export in WebFetch, XML
        or RDF output formats

0.09 Sun Aug 15 03:56:47 PDT 1999
      - added XML fetching for WebFetch::Slashdot, patch by Dan Sully
      - added WebFetch::LinuxTelephony, contributed by Greg Youngblood
      - added WebFetch::LinuxDevNet
      - added WebFetch::32BitsOnline

0.08 Sun Aug  1 22:58:48 PDT 1999
      - added WebFetch::DebianNews, contributed by Chuck Ritter
      - updated TODO with plans for site configuration, and
        prioritization notes about what's required for WebFetch 1.0
      - added --noshuffle to WebFetch::COLA
      - updated WebFetch core docs, moved style parameter docs to command line

0.07 Tue Jul  6 05:50:29 PDT 1999
      - obsoleted WebFetch::EGAuthors because eGroups changes their site too
        often to keep up with (and has no direct news-export support)
      - added WebFetch::CNETnews, contributed by Jamie Heilman
      - updated WebFetch::CNNsearch to allow keyword-only searches.
        This became necessary when a Linux story got on all the
	"in other news" pages at CNN and suddenly all pages on CNN
	matched a search for Linux.  This release also fixed a bug
	with non-Linux searches, reported by Jamie Heilman.
      - New --style command line option was added to control the internal
        HTML style parameter.  Some new style strings were added
	(notable, bullet)
