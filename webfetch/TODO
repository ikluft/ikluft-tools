WebFetch To-Do List
$Revision: 1.2 $
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Use the Perl5 "Resources" module to add a configuration infrastructure to
  the core WebFetch.pm which reads site defaults and configuration from a
  file
  [required for 1.0]
* Once the config files are in, add a feature which can schedule WebFetch
  modules with specific parameters to be launched at various times.
  This is to replace the currently-necessary launch scripts with all their
  parameters.
* Add docs for each WebFetch-derived module explaining better how to call
  it from within Perl.  (Current docs emphasize the command line because
  that's how it's been used.  But it isn't the only way to use it.)
  [required for 1.0]
* add more fetch modules:
  * calendar/upcoming events [wanted for 1.0]
  * XML downloads [wanted for 1.0]
  * RDF downloads [wanted for 1.0]
  * dmoz.org Open Directory Project RDF download [wanted for 1.0]
  * ARRL W1AW bulletins
  * California State OES bulletins
  * watch for updates to any web page from a specified list
  * others as submitted by users
